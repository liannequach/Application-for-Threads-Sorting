# Application-for-Threads-Sorting
This project focuses on the topic of threads and the application of using multiple threads.
In this project, we have a list of integers that we must sort to increasing order. The list gets
separated into two equal lists half the size of the original. Two subthreads are created to sort the
two new sublists. A merging thread takes the assorted sublists and assorts them into a single
sorted list.
